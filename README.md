This is a script for Krita that lets you quickly switch between three brush "slots".

One of these slots has the eraser option permanently toggled on with the other have it toggled off.

Each slot remeber the last brush it had and it also stores the size of the brush.

To install this script, copy the contents of this repository to `~/.local/share/krita/`
