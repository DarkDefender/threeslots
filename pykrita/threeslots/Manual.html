<h1 id="ten-brushes">Three Slots</h1>
<p>A Script that allow you to have three independed paint brush slots bound to configurable hotkeys.</p>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Use the hotkeys from this plugin to quickly switch between three brush slots.
The slots will save the last used brush and size for that specific slot.
The first slot will always toggle on eraser mode when it is active. The other slots will in return toggle eraser mode off.</p>

<p>This is so that you can organize your bursh usage a bit better. So for example, you can easily switch between eraser, normal brushes, and smudge brushes this way without locking yourself to three specific brush presets.</p>

<p>Go to <strong>Settings → Configure Krita → Keyboard Shortcuts</strong> to configure the hotkeys for the three slots.</p>
